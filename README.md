## My Calculator

# What is the purpose of this project?
This is my second project relearing web developement. For my second project, I decided to build a calculator but with more of the styling at focus. I worked with the regular HTML, CSS, and Javascript but also used Bootstrap.css as a CSS framework. Working with Bootstrap was definitely a learing curve when setting up the HTML body and using all the built in classes for components and styling. After some research I figured out how I wanted to lay out the project. I also learned some more CSS with the background styling. My biggest issues were figuring out the Javascript and how the functionality would work. I did have to follow a tutorial but I did learn more about classes and will continue to study more about them and how to work with them.
